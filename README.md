# uuidgen

Simply web app that showcases UUID generation. Frontend -> ChakraUI, 'Backend' -> Express, Routing->Ngnix
UUID generator that uses sine and cos functions to generate noise based on a seed that's generated using the mac address of the eth0/lo0 (in case of testing) and the current sys CPU clock

Data.txt is populated whenever a new UUID is generated (really, really basic emulation of a database)
